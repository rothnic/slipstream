description: Fix the last failed command
---

The last command failed.

**Command:** !`fc -ln -1`

**Exit code:** !`echo $?`

**Error context:**
!`tail -20 ~/.zsh_history 2>/dev/null | tail -5`

Analyze the error and:
1. Explain what went wrong
2. Provide a corrected command

Format the fix as a code block I can copy and run.
